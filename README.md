# HR Employee Attrition & Performance analysis

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing the HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, a collection of over 35 columns of employee-related data. This data set contains information on employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. These data points provide a valuable foundation for understanding the complex factors influencing employee turnover within organizations. The dataset serves as an invaluable resource for exploring the multifaceted factors that drive employee turnover, which remains a critical issue for organizations aiming to retain talent, maintain team cohesion, and reduce operational costs. The goal is to derive insight and uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. Ultimately to:

 - Explore Data relationships: Analyze correlation between employee demographics, job satisfaction, and attrition rates.
 - Segment Employee Groups: Understand attrition trends within specific departments, job levels, or work-life balance.
 - Salary Observation: Reveal interesting patterns relating to employee salaries and their potential impact.

Important terminology:

- **DAILY RATE**: Salary Level.
- **EMPLOYEE NUMBER**: Employee ID
- **EMPLOYEE COUNT**: Number of Employee.

## Executive Summary

The analysis is based on a dataset of 8 million records, providing insights into sessions, bounce rates, and device usage over 2014-2019. This information was visualized in a Tableau dashboard and revealed key insights into how users access the site, what devices they use, and patterns of engagement over time. The analysis shows that desktop is the dominant device for sessions, mobile has the highest bounce rate, and web traffic tends to peak during the weekdays, with notable spikes during critical events like the December 2017 wildfires. There has also been a steady decline in site traffic in the 2017-2019.

## Summary of Insights

- **Device Category Breakdown**:
    - **Desktop** brings in the most sessions (66% of the total).
    - **Mobile** ranks second but has the highest bounce rate (~6% higher than desktop).
    - **Tablets** bring in the least amount of traffic, though they have a lower bounce rate compared to mobile.
  
- **Browser Insights**:
    - On **desktop**, Chrome is the most-used browser.
    - On **mobile** and **tablet**, Safari dominates the sessions.
    - The default mobile browsers (Safari in-app and Android Browser) tend to have higher bounce rates, contributing to mobileâ€™s higher overall bounce rate.

- **Traffic Trends**:
    - Weekdays see significantly higher traffic compared to weekends.
    - There is a notable **traffic spike in December 2017**, which correlates with multiple wildfires that occurred in California during that time. The spike suggests the website was used as a key information hub during that crisis.
    - A **steady decline in traffic from 2017 to 2019** was observed, indicating a need to investigate factors behind this trend.

## Recommendations

I would then present these findings and recommendations to the HR department.

- **Review Business Travel Policies**: Frequent business travel contributes to higher attrition. Adjusting travel requirements or compensating employees more for travel-related burdens could help mitigate this trend.

- **Targeted Retention Strategies for Overtime**: Tailor initiatives to lowerr attrition rate among employees who take overtimes.
  
- **Improve Environment Satisfaction**: Since the less environmental satisfaction you have is correlated with the higher attirirotn rate, focus on making the environmrnt as satisfactory to the employees as possible.
