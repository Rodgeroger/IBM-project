# HR Employee Attrition & Performance analysis

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing the HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, a collection of over 35 columns of employee-related data. This data set contains information on employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. These data points provide a valuable foundation for understanding the complex factors influencing employee turnover within organizations. The dataset serves as an invaluable resource for exploring the multifaceted factors that drive employee turnover, which remains a critical issue for organizations aiming to retain talent, maintain team cohesion, and reduce operational costs. The goal is to derive insight and uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. Ultimately to:

 - Explore Data relationships: Analyze correlation between employee demographics, job satisfaction, and attrition rates.
 - Segment Employee Groups: Understand attrition trends within specific departments, job levels, or work-life balance.
 - Salary Observation: Reveal interesting patterns relating to employee salaries and their potential impact.

Important terminology:

- **DAILY RATE**: Salary Level.
- **EMPLOYEE NUMBER**: Employee ID
- **EMPLOYEE COUNT**: Number of Employee.

## Summary of Insights

- **Device Category Breakdown**:
    - **Desktop** brings in the most sessions (66% of the total).
    - **Mobile** ranks second but has the highest bounce rate (~6% higher than desktop).
    - **Tablets** bring in the least amount of traffic, though they have a lower bounce rate compared to mobile.
  
- **Browser Insights**:
    - On **desktop**, Chrome is the most-used browser.
    - On **mobile** and **tablet**, Safari dominates the sessions.
    - The default mobile browsers (Safari in-app and Android Browser) tend to have higher bounce rates, contributing to mobileâ€™s higher overall bounce rate.

- **Traffic Trends**:
    - Weekdays see significantly higher traffic compared to weekends.
    - There is a notable **traffic spike in December 2017**, which correlates with multiple wildfires that occurred in California during that time. The spike suggests the website was used as a key information hub during that crisis.
    - A **steady decline in traffic from 2017 to 2019** was observed, indicating a need to investigate factors behind this trend.

## Recommendations

I would then present these findings and recommendations to the HR department.

- **Review Business Travel Policies**: Frequent business travel contributes to higher attrition. Adjusting travel requirements or compensating employees more for travel-related burdens could help mitigate this trend.

- **Targeted Retention Strategies for Overtime**: Tailor initiatives to lowerr attrition rate among employees who take overtimes.
  
- **Improve Environment Satisfaction**: Since the less environmental satisfaction you have is correlated with the higher attrition rate, focus on making the environment as satisfactory to the employees as possible.

- **Improve Job Satisfaction**: Since the less job satisfaction you have is correlated with a higher attrition rate, focus on making the environment as satisfactory to the employees as possible.
