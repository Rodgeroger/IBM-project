# HR Employee Attrition & Performance analysis

## Project Background

This project focuses on analyzing the HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, a collection of over 35 columns of employee-related data. This data set contains information on employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. These data points provide a valuable foundation for understanding the complex factors influencing employee turnover within organizations. The dataset serves as an invaluable resource for exploring the multifaceted factors that drive employee turnover, which remains a critical issue for organizations aiming to retain talent, maintain team cohesion, and reduce operational costs. The goal is to derive insight and uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. Ultimately to:

 - Explore Data relationships: Analyze correlation between employee demographics, job satisfaction, and attrition rates.
 - Segment Employee Groups: Understand attrition trends within specific departments, job levels, or work-life balance.
 - Salary Observation: Reveal interesting patterns relating to employee salaries and their potential impact.

SQL Skills Used: Data Cleaning, Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTE), Window functions, Aggregations, Group By, Data Type Conversion, and Data Transformation

Broke up into three tables as instructed

## Recommendations

I would then present these findings and recommendations to the HR department.

- **Targeted Retention Strategies for Overtime**: Tailor initiatives to lowerr attrition rate among employees who take overtimes.
  
- **Improve Environment Satisfaction**: Since the less environmental satisfaction you have is correlated with the higher attrition rate, focus on making the environment as satisfactory to the employees as possible.

- **Improve Job Satisfaction**: Since the less job satisfaction you have is correlated with a higher attrition rate, focus on making the environment as satisfactory to the employees as possible.
